          This endpoint is used by the clearinghouse portal to reset a user’s password or get the username in case the users/admins forget their password or username. This will enable them to access the portal.  

          The API allows the user/admin to:
          * Reset the password if the action type is mentioned as ‘ForgotPassword’, 
          *	Get the username by passing the action type as ‘ForgotUsername’.

          The data for resetting passwords or getting usernames are first validated in the ECHO Hub system, and the request is then sent to the clearinghouse library. Once the requested action is performed, the ECHO Hub will send a success message along with a link to reset the password or username details to their email ID.  
          
          Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
