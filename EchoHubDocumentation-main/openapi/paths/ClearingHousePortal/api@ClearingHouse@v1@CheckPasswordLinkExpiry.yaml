   The clearinghouse portal will consume this endpoint to check if the link to create the password is active or expired.  

   The data for checking if the create password link is active or expired is first validated in the ECHO Hub system, and the request is then sent to the clearinghouse library. Once checked, the ECHO Hub system will return the response.  

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
