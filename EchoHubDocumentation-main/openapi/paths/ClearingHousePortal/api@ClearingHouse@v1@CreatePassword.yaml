   This endpoint consumed by the clearinghouse portal allows the clearinghouse portal user to create a password through the link sent via email post-approval by ECHO admins or clearinghouse admins. The password is required to log in and access the clearinghouse portal.  

   The data for creating a password is first validated in the ECHO Hub system, and the request is then sent to the clearinghouse library. Once the password is created, the ECHO Hub will send a success message.  

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
