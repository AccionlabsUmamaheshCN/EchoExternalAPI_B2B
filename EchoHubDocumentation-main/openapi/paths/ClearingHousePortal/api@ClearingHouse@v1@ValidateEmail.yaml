  summary: Clearinghouse Portal - Validate OTP sent in email
  x-internal: true
  operationId: CHPValidateEmailProcess
  security:
    - x-Authorization: []
  description: |
   The clearinghouse portal will consume this API in the login process of clearinghouse portal users/admins/ECHO admins to validate OTP sent to the registered email address for TFA.  
   
   The ECHO Hub system validates the details provided and sends the request to ECHO Security for validating the OTP. If there are any errors, a response is sent back for each request.  

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
