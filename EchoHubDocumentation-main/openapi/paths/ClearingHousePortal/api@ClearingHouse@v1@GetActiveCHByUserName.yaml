   This endpoint is used to get all the active clearinghouse lists by username. The clearinghouse portal will consume this API in the clearinghouse ECHO admin and clearinghouse admin dashboards. It enables the admins to get the list of clearinghouses which helps them to select the respective clearinghouse globally.  

   The data for getting the active clearinghouse by username is first validated in the ECHO Hub system, and the request is then sent to the clearinghouse library. Once the data is obtained, the ECHO Hub will return a response that includes the list of active clearinghouses.  

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
