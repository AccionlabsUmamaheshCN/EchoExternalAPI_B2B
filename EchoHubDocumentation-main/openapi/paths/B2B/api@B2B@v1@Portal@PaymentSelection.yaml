   The B2B enroll application uses this API to make a request to submit a user registration for a particular payment type. This endpoint enables user registration and payment conversion.  

   When there is a request from a B2B form for the user registration and payment type selection, the data is passed to ECHO Hub. The ECHO Hub system validates the data, and the request is then sent to the B2B library. Once the user is registered and payment is converted, ECHO Hub sends a success message.  
   
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
