   This API enables the B2B portal application to update the user profile information. The B2B portal consumes this endpoint and helps the user to keep the profile information current.  

   When there is a request from a B2B form to update a user profile, the data is passed to ECHO Hub. The ECHO Hub system validates the data, and the request is then sent to the B2B library. Once the profile of the user is updated, ECHO Hub sends a success message.     
   
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
