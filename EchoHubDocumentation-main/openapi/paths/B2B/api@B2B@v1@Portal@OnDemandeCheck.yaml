   This endpoint allows the API user to request an on-demand eCheck from the B2B portal application. An eCheck will be requested from Deluxe for the draft number provided in the request. Once the eCheck is created, another request is sent to Deluxe to download an image of the eCheck so that the user can download and/or print the eCheck.  

   The data for creating an eCheck is first validated in the ECHO Hub system and is then sent to the B2B portal library. Once the eCheck is created, ECHO Hub sends a success message.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
