   This API enables the B2B portal application to get a B2B payee’s business account profile. The B2B portal consumes this endpoint and helps the user view the business account information of the payee.

   When there is a request from a B2B form to retrieve the business account information of a payee, the data is passed to ECHO Hub. The ECHO Hub system validates the data, and the request is then sent to the B2B library. Once the requested information is obtained, ECHO Hub sends a success message.
 
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
