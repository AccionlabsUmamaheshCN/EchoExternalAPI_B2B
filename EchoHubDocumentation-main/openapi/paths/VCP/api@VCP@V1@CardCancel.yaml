            * Block – Card will be blocked.        
    
            * Block and Reissue – The card will be blocked, and then a new card will
            be reissued.       
    
            * Block and Opt out – Card will be blocked and opted out.       
    
            * Reissue – Provides status of payment before reissue.
          

            
            Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization
