  description:  This API makes sure the card is active, before cancelling or closing the card. It also helps to check the card balance by showing the transactions.
                This endpoint validates two functionalities – The status of the card and the transactions of the card.
               

                
                Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization
                token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
