   This endpoint allows the user to add a payee name for an ACH payment. The data for adding a payee is first validated in the ECHO Hub system and is then directed to the ACH library. Once the payeeâ€™s name is added, the ECHO Hub system will send a success message.
   
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
