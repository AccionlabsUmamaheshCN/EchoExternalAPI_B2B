   This endpoint is used when ECHO Hub receives a request to cancel a payment from any of the payment modalities such as Direct to Debit, Venmo, or Zelle. The API allows the ECHO Vault to receive a request from ECHO Hub payment modalities for payment cancellation. The payor is identified with the unique payor reference ID.

   On receiving a request, the ECHO Hub system validates the data and directs it to the ECHO Vault. ECHO Vault will then call the appropriate vendor/third-party API to cancel a payment based on the unique payor reference ID and returns the response.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
