   This API ensures that the vault process is up and running.  

   The endpoint is used by consumers who intend to view the current state of the vault process. If the vault system is running properly, it will return a success response as ‘status verified’, and in the case of any issues, the response is returned as ‘status failed’.  
   
   This endpoint uses 'VaultToken' as the input parameter.  
   VaultToken – This is the token associated with the payee’s existing details (card or account information). A blank field indicates that the session is cancelled without making a payment.

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
