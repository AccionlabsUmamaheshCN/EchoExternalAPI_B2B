   When the vault token is passed, it will hit the ECHO Vault library and fetch the card/account information based on the vault token. 

   This endpoint uses 'VaultToken' as the input parameter.  
   Vault Token - This is the token associated with the payeeâ€™s existing details (card or account information). A blank field indicates that the session is cancelled without making a payment.
