   This endpoint enables the API user to get bank-related information such as bank account numbers and routing numbers from ECHO Vault. This requires the vault token to return the bank details in an encrypted format.  

   This endpoint uses 'VaultToken' as the input parameter.  
   VaultToken - This is the token associated with the payeeâ€™s existing details (card or account information). A blank field indicates that the session is cancelled without making a payment.  
   
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
