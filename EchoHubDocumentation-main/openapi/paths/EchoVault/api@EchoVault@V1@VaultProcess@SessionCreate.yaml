   This API enables the consumer who chooses to use the embedded web application to create a new session and get the vault session information.  

   When the WYSIWIG URL is passed, this endpoint enables the calling application to connect to WYSIWIG to bring up the form to allow the consumer payee to create or access the PCI-compliant data.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
