   This API is used to verify the consumer who chooses to open an embedded web application to have access and get all the vault session details for the ECHO vault. The endpoint is used when ECHO Vault receives the request to initialize the card entry.  

   When the consumer opens the embedded web application, the ECHO Vault library verifies the data; and based on the vault session ID, all the card/payment information is retrieved.
  
   This endpoint uses 'VaultSessionID' as the input parameter.  
   VaultSessionID â€“ This is the unique identifier for each vault WYSIWIG session.   

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
