   This endpoint is used when ECHO Hub receives a request to view the status of a payment that may be Direct to Debit, Venmo, or Zelle. The API allows the ECHO Vault to receive the payment status request from the ECHO Hub system.  

   On receiving a request, the ECHO Hub system validates the data and directs it to the ECHO Vault. ECHO Vault will then call the appropriate vendor/third-party API to get the payment status based on the unique payor reference ID and returns the response.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
