   This endpoint is used when ECHO Hub receives a request to create a payment from any of the payment modalities that may be Direct to Debit, Venmo, or Zelle. The API allows the ECHO Vault to receive a request from ECHO Hub payment modalities to create a payment. The payor is identified with the unique payor reference ID.  

   On receiving a request, the ECHO Hub system validates the data and helps get a vault token based on ECHO Payee ID. Once the vault token is obtained, the data is passed to the ECHO Vault to create a payment. Upon successful transaction, the ECHO Hub system returns a success message in response.

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
