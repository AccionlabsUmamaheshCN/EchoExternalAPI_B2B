  summary: Direct to Debit Payment Create
  description: | 
   This endpoint allows the API user to create a Payment to the Payee.  
   The Payor is identified with the unique Payor reference ID. This is the Payorâ€™s unique reference ID for them to access the status or cancellation of the Payment. 
   This is unique to all payments submitted by a Payor.

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization
     token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
