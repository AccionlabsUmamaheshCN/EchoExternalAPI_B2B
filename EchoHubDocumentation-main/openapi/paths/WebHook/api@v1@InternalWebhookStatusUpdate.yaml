   This endpoint helps find all the non-cleared and non-cancelled payments in each payment modality (Direct to Debit, Zelle, and Venmo) and checks their current status. An active batch is triggered once a day and verifies for payments older than 24 hours. This requires the third-party reference ID, which identifies the Payor transaction to get the status. Based on the current status and Reference ID, we call the third-party webhook status update endpoint.
   The current status can be:
   * Cancelled
   * Returned
   * Refunded
   * Rejected
   * Expired
   * Failed
   * Deleted
   * Payee Approval Declined
   * Success
   * Delivered
   * Payee Approval Confirmed
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
