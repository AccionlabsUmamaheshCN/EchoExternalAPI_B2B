   This endpoint sends real-time status updates of payments from the active batch that is triggered to the ECHO Hub application. Once the status of the payment is determined, the ECHO Hub application responds by updating the status received by the third-party webhook status endpoint. This response is then passed to the system of record in the ECHO Hub application to update their information to cancel the payment or mark the payment as cleared.

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
